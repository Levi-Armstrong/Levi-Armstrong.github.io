## 1. Goal
 * The purpose of these exercises is to implement a ROS node that drives a robot through a series of moves and actions in order to complete a pick and place task.  In addition, they will serve as an example of how to integrate a variety of software capabilities (perception, controller drivers, I/O, inverse kinematics, path planning, collision avoidance, etc) into a ROS-based industrial application.  

## 2. Objectives
 * Understand the components and structure of a real or simulated robot application.
 * Learn how to command robot moves using Moveit!.
 * Learn how to move the arm to a joint or Cartesian position.
 * Leverage perception capabilities including AR tag recognition and PCL.
 * Plan collision-free paths for a pick and place task.
 * Control robot peripherals such as a gripper.
