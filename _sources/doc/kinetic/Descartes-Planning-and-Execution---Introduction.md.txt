## 1. Goal
 * This application will demonstrate how to use the various components in the Descartes library for planning and executing a robot path from a semi-constrained trajectory of points.  

## 2. Objectives
 * Become familiar with the Descartes workflow.
 * Learn how to load a custom Descartes RobotModel.
 * Learn how to create a semi-constrained trajectory from 6DOF tool poses.
 * Plan a robot path with a Descartes Planner.
 * Convert a Descartes Path into a MoveIt! message for execution.
 * Executing the path on the robot.
